## Background

In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so you want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing your proposal on only returns and volatility, you want to include other factors that might impact the crypto market—leading to better performance for your portfolio.

When you present the idea, your manager loves it! So, you’re asked to create a prototype for submitting your crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.

## What You're Creating

In this Challenge, you’ll combine your financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills that you acquired in this module.

You’ll create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. You’ll then plot the results so that you can visually show the performance to the board.

The CSV file that’s provided for this Challenge contains the price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.


## Instructions

Use the starter code file to complete the tasks outlined in the Instructions. The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

    Import the Data (provided in the starter code)

    Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
    Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
    Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
    Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
    Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
